# Project

### Random data is generated:
- 10 features.
- 1000 examples.
- the samples are generated from the standard normal distribution.
- each example (row) is assigned a target of 0 or 1.
- refer to 01_generate-dat.py for the code

### Random data is plotted:
- scatter plot is used.
- feature 2 vs. feature 1
- point colour is used to differentiate target class
- refer to 02_visualize-data.py for the code

### Data is used to predict the target:
- a logistic regression model is trained.
- the model is evaluated with the testing set.
- the model predictions are visualized on a scatter plot.
- refer to the report for the code used to train, test, and evaluate the model.
- refer to 03-plot-predictions.py for the code to generate the prediction scatter plot.

### Notes:
- the report summarizes the process in more detail - .ipynb or .pdf may be viewed.
